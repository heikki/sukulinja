# Let the self-extractor's "Installation complete" panel close itself.
#
# An --env=stable build is a SELF-EXTRACTOR: the real app bundle lives
# compressed in Contents/Resources/<hash>.tar.zst and is unpacked over the
# bundle on first launch. The extractor then shows a modeless "Installation
# complete" panel and launches the app without waiting for it, so the panel is
# left stranded behind the app window with a Close button nobody asked for.
# ELECTROBUN_INSTALLER_UI_AUTOCLOSE dismisses it; LSEnvironment on the stub is
# how a Finder launch gets to see the variable.
#
# The outer stub's plist is the only one that needs it: it is the one in play on
# the single launch that extracts, and extraction then replaces it with the
# payload's copy — so the variable is gone by the time the app runs normally.
#
# Patching a sealed resource means the outer bundle has to be re-signed, or the
# signature no longer matches and macOS refuses to launch it. That is also why
# this runs before the copy to /Applications, not after.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run.
